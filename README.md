### Hi there 👋

I'm Phil and I'm currently figuring out how I can combine my passion for programming with fighting climate change 🌍

Since the beginning of 2018 I have submitted over 200 Pull Requests to Clippy, rustc and other various Rust projects. You can find the full list [**here**](https://philhansch.net/onehundred/rust/).

If you consider my contributions worthwhile, I'd like to ask you to consider sponsoring my open source work in return. You can do that easily by going to my [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/phansch?o=esc) or via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=14028769). Any support is much appreciated :heart:
