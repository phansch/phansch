### Hi there 👋

I'm Phil and I'm currently figuring out how I can combine my passion for programming with fighting climate change 🌍

Since the beginning of 2018 I have submitted over 200 Pull Requests to Clippy, rustc and other various Rust projects. You can find the full list [**here**](https://philhansch.net/onehundred/rust/). I'm currently not involved with Rust anymore and focusing on other things.

I am in the process of moving to Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/philhansch
