### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Phil and love Rust! As a Clippy team member you can find me mostly working on Clippy and Rust Diagnostics related issues.

If you consider my contributions worthwhile, I'd like to ask you to consider sponsoring my open source work in return. You can do that easily by going to my [GitHub Sponsors profile](https://github.com/sponsors/phansch?o=esc) or via [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=14028769). Any support is much appreciated :heart:

- âš¡ Fun fact: Since the beginning of 2018 I have submitted over 200 Pull Requests to Clippy, rustc and other various Rust projects. You can find the full list [**here**](https://phansch.net/onehundred/rust/).
- ðŸ”­ You can find my currently active projects on my [personal Rust project dashboard](https://github.com/users/phansch/projects/3)
